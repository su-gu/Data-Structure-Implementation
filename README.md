# Data-Structure-Implementation
In this repository, i've tried to implement some data structures
- Implement an ArrayList/Vector using static arrays
  - It should support the following operations:
    - add
    - remove
    - contains
    - size

- Implement a stack using a linked list
  - It should support the following operations:
    - push
    - pop
    - peek
    - isEmpty

- Implement a HashMap using a static array. Assuming that this hashmap will never need to be resized/rehashed
  - It should support the following operations:
    - insert
    - delete
    - contains
